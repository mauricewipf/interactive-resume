      <h1>{{page.title}} Maurice Wipf</h1>

      <p>
        Studying BA and Engineering in Germany and Mexico, he discovered his love for coding.
        Realizing that his soccer skills wouldn't pay the bills, he began his career in an early-stage
        German/American startup. Today equipped with a sense for design and challenging himself with side projects.
        When you find him off the computer, he typically reads&nbsp;📖, runs&nbsp;🏃 and travels&nbsp;🏝.
