			<h1>{{page.title}} Maurice Wipf</h1>

			<p>
				While studying BA and Engineering in Germany and Mexico, I discovered my love for coding. 
				Realizing that my soccer skills	wouldn't pay the bills, I began my career in an 
				early-stage German/American startup. In 2018 after 3 years as project manager, I turned 
				my passion into my profession and became a front-end developer. In the same year I finished 
				an educational program to become a <a href="https://confirm.udacity.com/9G9JGUSF">Mobile 
				Web Specialist</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I build web applications and my focus is on the front-end. I am passionate about diving 
				into new technologies. My stack includes Angular, Oracle JET, Bootstrap, JavaScript, 
				HTML, CSS and Node.js.
			</p>
				When you find me off the computer, I typically read&nbsp;📖, run&nbsp;🏃 and travel&nbsp;🏝.
