			<h1>Maurice Wipf</h1>
			<h2>Software Developer</h2>

			<p>
				While studying BA and Engineering in Germany and Mexico, I discovered my love for coding. Realizing that my soccer skills
				wouldn't pay the bills, I began my career in an early-stage German/American startup. In 2018 after 3 years as project
				manager, I turned my passion into my profession and became a front-end developer. In the same year I finished an educational
				program to become a
				<a href="https://confirm.udacity.com/9G9JGUSF">Mobile Web Specialist</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I build web applications and my focus is on the front-end. I am passionate about diving into new technologies. My stack includes
				Angular, Oracle JET, Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Node.js.
			</p>
			When you find me off the computer, I typically read&nbsp;üìñ, run&nbsp;üèÉ and travel&nbsp;üèù.

			<h3>Ideation</h3>
			<p>
				Over the years I‚Äôve developed a curious mindset. I read lots of books as well as tech news because I love to know about
				the latest technologies out there and how they impact our lives. By sourcing information from different media, there are
				new ideas popping up in my mind. I write all of them down, no matter how odd or crazy they seem in the first place. Some
				of them I refine and share with others.

			<h3>Design</h3>
			<p>
				 Everything that is not made by nature is artificial by definition. What sounds profound at first, means nothing less, that
				almost everything we touch in our lives has someone designed someday. Everything is design. And the counterintuitive truth
				is: "<a href="https://github.com/mauricewipf/10-Principles-of-Good-Design">Good design is as little design as possible.</a>" (Dieter&nbsp;Rams)

			<h3>Software</h3>
			<p>
				It all started with iWeb, a software that was shipped with Apple OSX until 2011. It is a WYSIWYG-Editor to build websites.
				My first ‚Äûweb app‚Äú was then a trivial pursuit game about The Simpsons! Up to today I‚Äôm driven by my own ideas that I want
				to bring alive. In numerous projects I‚Äôve built a tech stack including the latest web technologies.
