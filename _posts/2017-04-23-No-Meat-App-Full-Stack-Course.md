I started a web development course to improve my programming skills.
The <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack">course</a> covered everything from frontend, backend,
databases, testing and deployment.

In the final capstone project I implemented an idea I had some time ago. With the No Meat App you can track days on that
you haven't eaten meat. I made <a href="https://www.mauwi.me/projects/no-meat-app/">a prototype of the app</a> when I
had this idea one and a half year ago. For this, there is a calendar and you click on the days that you want to
highlight. Also you can create new calendars for other goals you want to track.

I finished the course with
a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/NR7UJUTUADRB">certification from
Coursera</a>.

The code is Open Source and <a href="https://github.com/mauricewipf/No-Meat-App">published on GitHub</a>.
