Wo ist Markt? aims at providing an easy to use website for market information. Visitors of the website should be able to intuitively get answers to the following questions:

- Where does a market take place?
- When does a market take place?

Therefore, the website shows the position of markets as markers on a map. Each marker can be clicked or tapped to reveal the detail information associated with this market - most important, the opening hours. This can been seen on the following screenshot.

The project has been started by <a href="https://twitter.com/torfsen">@torfsen</a> as part of the Open Knowledge Lab Karlsruhe in February 2015.
